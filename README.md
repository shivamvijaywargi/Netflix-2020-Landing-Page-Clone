# Another Netflix Landing Page Clone.

### Made this to learn about advanced CSS properties.

## For Live preview please visit https://shivamvijaywargi.github.io/Netflix-2020-Landing-Page-Clone/

## Todo:

#### 1. Make website Responsive.

#### 2. Fix Accordion for FAQ.

#### 3. Of course clean code (It is ugly AF right now).

#### 4. Refactor many code snippets to follow best practices.

## This is how Netflix Landing page looked as of 20 June 2020.

## Do note this is not an exact replica but how I liked it to be with somethings that I could not replicate for now.
